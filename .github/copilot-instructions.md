This project is a React-based browser IDE for MarathiScript (TanishLang). All compilation and execution logic must run fully in the frontend. Include components for:
- MarathiScript code editor (with code highlighting)
- Compiled JavaScript viewer
- Output/result display
- Parser/compiler logic for MarathiScript to JS
- Safe JS execution in-browser

Do not use any backend/server. Use modern React best practices.
